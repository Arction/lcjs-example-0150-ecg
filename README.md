# JavaScript ECG Chart

![JavaScript ECG Chart](ecg.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows a simulated ECG-signal by using a Line Series in a XY Chart.

The simulated signal pushes 960 points per second to the chart.

ECG stands for electrocardiogram which is a simple test that can be used to check heart's rhythm and electrical activity.
